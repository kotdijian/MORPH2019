## 2. What Shape can tell us about Homo erectus’ Mind  
   Cory Marie Stade  

As archaeological morphometricians we are invariably interested in the form artefacts take, and how they change over time and across space. The end goal of our study is to better understand the behaviour of the makers and users of these artefacts. Cognitive archaeology is the study that connects these interpreted behaviours to the workings of the mind. In this way, we can build a bridge from artefact form and shape, to behaviour, to what ancient minds were like. I will explore different works that connect shape to cognition, including two case studies of my own research. In the first, shape is connected to mind through how copying fidelity affects levels of standardisation at the assemblage level. In a lithic knapping experiment, different simulated social learning methods, which use increasing levels of cognitive sophistication, are shown to produce decreasing levels of morphological variability in a geometric morphometric analysis of 2D outline shape. The conclusion is that very low level of morphological variability in a sophisticated technology may only be possible by a community with sophisticated copying mechanisms. Copying is cognitively complex, and requires the copier to think about the thoughts of others – called ‘theory of mind’. Theory of mind, in turn, relies on language for its development. The makers of idiosyncratic tools therefore may have also been language users. In the second case study, with Dr John McNabb, we take a new look at the shape of Acheulean artefacts from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Resourcefully collected from archived trace outlines, hundreds more handaxes from this site have been made available for our analysis. Both outline shape and symmetry are combined in an innovative metric, and examined at different localities at Olduvai. Even when dealing with artefacts over such a range of time, we find a general similarity in both median values and the range of values over different localities and timeframes. Certain shapes do not appear more symmetrical than others, which would be expected if certain sites or groups of artefacts were producing handaxes which had more intentional shaping to them. Has this metric captured a general lack of differentiation in intentional shaping? Does stability in shape represent stangnancy, or complex cultural transmission? With these two studies, this presentation will emphasise the far-reaching implications morphometric studies have for not only human behaviour, but for understanding the mental worlds of our ancestors.  


## 3. Integration and modularity of the primate pelvic girdle  
   Katrien G. Janin  

Integration and modularity are connected concepts that have become a central framework within evolutionary biology, providing a unifying theory of organismal structured patterns and variation to those patterns that can be applied at multiple hierarchical levels. The concepts are similar to those used in systems theory and network analysis, conceptualizing biological organisms as a system of parts working together through a series of networks with the interrelated parts having varying degrees of interconnectedness among them.  
Precise definitions of integration and modularity are surprisingly elusive. At its broadest definition, morphological integration refers to the level of cohesion, the tendency for parts to be interlinked and consequently shape changes in a coordinated manner. A morphological module is a unit (e.g. morphological trait, anatomical element, etc.) that displays high levels of internal integration but between such modules low levels of integration exist, enabling them to operate relatively independent from each other. Modularity refers to the relative degrees of integration within the model system. Integration and modularity together configure the structured pattern that governs shape.  
Why is it important to study the structured patterns? A strongly integrated pattern constrains adaptation and restricts evolutionary options as traits must evolve together, whilst a more modular organisation tends to facilitate evolutionary divergence since selection can act relatively independently on each module. Gaining an understanding of the structured pattern and being able to recognise divergence in those patterns are key to gaining insights of the evolutionary processes at work.  
My research centres around the pelvis structure of humans and of our closest relatives, the non-human primates. The pelvis represents an interesting model system for the study of modularity and integration since primates display greater diversity in pelvis morphologies compared to other mammal groups. What enabled them to do so, and how changes to the structured pattern may have facilitated human bipedalism are the focus of my investigation.  
The presentation consists of three main parts: firstly, I will explain the core concepts of integration and modularity; and secondly how I applied these concepts using GMM to investigate the structured pattern within the primate pelvic girdle. I shall close the presentation by highlighting how these evolutionary biological concepts equally may serve archaeologists researching artefact changes through time.  


## 4. Inferring the anatomy of the Neanderthal brain using geometric morphometrics  
   Naomichi Ogihara  

The causes of the replacement of Neanderthals by anatomically modern humans remain key questions in paleoanthropology. One hypothesis that possibly explains the disappearance of Neanderthals and expansion of Homo sapiens is the differences in the cognitive or neural function between the two populations resulting from anatomical differences of the brain. To infer possible morphological differences in brain anatomy between the two species, we attempted to virtually reconstruct the brains of Neanderthals an early Homo sapiens using geometric morphometrics. Computed tomography scan data of Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens were obtained and 3D ecto- and endocranial surface models were virtually reconstructed using anatomical and sliding semi-landmarks defined on the surfaces. Then we reconstructed the brain morphology of each fossil cranium using a spatial deformation function. Specifically, the 3D structure of the average human brain and endocast were obtained by MRI scans from living humans, and the 3D structure of the fossil brain was reconstructed by deforming the human brain using the deformation function from the human endocast to each fossil endocast. The volume of each brain region was also estimated using the neuroanatomical labels for the brain locations. The virtually reconstructed fossil brains revealed that early Homo sapiens had relatively larger cerebellar hemispheres but a smaller occipital regions in the cerebrum than Neanderthals. Such a neuroanatomical difference in the brain may have caused important differences in cognitive and social abilities between the two species and might have contributed to the replacement process.
